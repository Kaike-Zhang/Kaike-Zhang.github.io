[DyTed: Disentangled Representation Learning for Discrete-time Dynamic Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10592.pdf)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Gaolin Fang, Bingbing Xu, Hongjian Zou, Huawei Sheng, Xueqi Cheng
- To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study and introduce the disentangled representation learning framework for discrete-time dynamic graphs.
- We propose two representation generators with carefully designed pretext tasks and a disentanglement-aware discriminator under an adversarial learning framework.
- We conduct extensive experiments on real dynamic graphs of daily capital transactions on Tencent, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks.
