[Understanding and Improving Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Robust Recommendation](#)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

- We provide theoretical evidence that ACF can achieve better performance and robustness compared to traditional CF in both clean and poisoned data contexts.
- We further identify upper and lower bounds of reduction in recommendation error for ACF during optimization and demonstrate that applying personalized perturbation magnitudes for each user can further improve ACF.
- Based on the above theoretical understandings, we propose Personalized Magnitude Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (PamaCF), with extensive experiments confirming that PamaCF further improves both performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art defense methods.

[PKAD: Pretrained Knowledge is All You Need to Detect and Mitigate Textual Backdoor Attacks](#)
Yu Chen, Qi Cao, **Kaike Zhang**, Xuchao Liu, Huawei Shen

- We delve into utilizing PLM insights to identify the mismatched relationship and shared characteristics of poisoned samples, forming a two-stage detection strategy.
- Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness across various datasets and attack strategies, achieving better performance more swiftly.

[Improving the Shortest Plank: Vulnerability-Aware Adversarial Training for Robust Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17476)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

- Through extensive empirical analysis, we interestingly find that “users with a higher degree of fit within the recommender system are at a higher risk of being affected by attacks”.
- Building on these insights, we introduce a novel vulnerability-aware adversarial training method, VAT, applying user-adaptive magnitudes of perturbations based on users’ vulnerabilities.
- Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VAT in resisting various attacks, maintaining recommendation quality, and demonstrating its adaptability across various recommendation models.

[Accelerating the Surrogate Retraining for Poisoning Attacks against Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10666)
Yunfan Wu, Qi Cao, Shuchang Tao, **Kaike Zhang**, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen
- We introduce a novel method Gradient Passing (GP) based on
both intuitive and theoretical analyses, accelerating the retraining
process of surrogate recommenders.
- We present the use of GP to enhance data poisoning attacks. It can
be integrated into state-of-the-art attack methods and combined
with other techniques.
- Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and six victim
recommenders validate the efficiency and effectiveness of GP.

[LoRec: Combating Poisons with Large Language Model for Robust Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17723.pdf)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Sheng, Xueqi Cheng
- We pioneer the exploration of LLMs' knowledge of fraudsters within recommender systems, revealing how LLMs' knowledge can aid defense methods in generalizing across various attacks.
- We lead the initiative of incorporating LLMs into the robustness of sequential recommender systems, introducing LoRec as an innovative and general framework that employs LLM-enhanced Calibration for robust sequential recommendations.
- Our extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of the LoRec framework in withstanding diverse types of attacks and its adaptability across multiple backbone recommendation architectures.

**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Gaolin Fang, Bingbing Xu, Hongjian Zou, Huawei Sheng, Xueqi Cheng
- To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study and introduce the disentangled representation learning framework for discrete-time dynamic graphs.
- We propose two representation generators with carefully designed pretext tasks and a disentanglement-aware discriminator under an adversarial learning framework.
- We conduct extensive experiments on real dynamic graphs of daily capital transactions on Tencent, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks.
